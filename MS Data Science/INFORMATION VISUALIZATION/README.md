# 🚗 Car Data Insights: Interactive Dashboard using D3.js

## 📌 Overview

This project presents an interactive web-based dashboard developed using **D3.js**, enabling users to explore performance, design, and origin-based trends in historical car data. The dashboard supports multiple dimensions of analysis, focusing on variables such as MPG, horsepower, cylinders, weight, and manufacturing origin. It was created as part of the Information Visualization course and aims to demonstrate effective storytelling through dynamic and interactive visualizations.

## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔹 `index.html` – Main Dashboard File

This file contains the complete implementation of the dashboard, including:

- **Parallel Coordinates Plot**  
  → Visualizes clustering of vehicles based on performance metrics like MPG, horsepower, cylinders, and weight.

- **Line Chart**  
  → Displays fuel efficiency trends from 1970 to 1982, segmented by car origin (USA, Europe, Japan).

- **Scatter Plot with Regression Line**  
  → Illustrates the relationship between horsepower and MPG, using point size to represent weight and a regression line for trend insight.

- **Bar Chart**  
  → Represents distribution of car production by manufacturer and origin in a clear, grouped view.

Each chart includes real-time interaction such as brushing, zooming, hovering tooltips, and filtering for deeper exploration.


## 🧠 Objectives & Tasks

The dashboard addresses four main analytical goals:

1. **Cluster vehicles** by key design/performance attributes  
   → Using a parallel coordinates plot to reveal similarities in technical specs

2. **Compare fuel efficiency over time**  
   → Using a multi-line chart grouped by vehicle origin to track MPG improvements or declines

3. **Analyze engine efficiency patterns**  
   → Using a scatter plot to compare horsepower against MPG and assess weight impact

4. **Understand regional production patterns**  
   → Using a bar chart to identify major manufacturers and their global distribution

Each visualization is built with usability and data clarity in mind.



## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- **D3.js v7** – Main library for data visualization
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Structuring and styling the dashboard
- **GitHub Pages** – Used to host the live project

All charts are coded manually using D3.js to ensure full customization and interaction flexibility.
